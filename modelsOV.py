You are a helpful assistant that identify the person, time, place and what happen in brief in the following article.
On Friday, January 1, 2016, at approximately 8:15 AM, I parked my car in the Food Mart parking lot, located at 1234 Food Dr., in Goleta. I left my car unlocked since I was planning to return quickly. While I was inside the Food Mart, I had realized I left my cellphone on top of the center console of my car. When I returned to my car, at approximately 8:20 AM, I discovered my carâ€™s front passenger door was ajar and my cellphone was gone. I did not see who stole my cellphone or know who could have stolen it. This report is for documentation purposes only.
